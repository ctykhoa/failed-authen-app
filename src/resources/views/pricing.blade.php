            Lorempixel - The best image generator I've found. Allows you to embed directly with a size and a category e.g. <img src="https://lorempixel.com/400/200/sports/" />. Also lets you specify greyscale or colour Dummy Image - If you don't want real images, this one generates a blank placeholder with the size written in the middle. Saves people working out what size image they need to send Fill Murray - Who doesn't love a website full of Bill?
